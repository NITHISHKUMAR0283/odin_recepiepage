    <h1>Description</h1>
    
    <p>Here's a simple lasagna recipe: Start by browning 1 pound of ground beef with diced onions and garlic, then mix in marinara sauce and let it simmer. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions and set aside. In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, an egg, and Italian seasoning. In a greased 9x13 baking dish, layer half the noodles, half the meat sauce, half the ricotta mixture, and half a bag of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers, then top with Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil and bake at 375Â°F for 25 minutes, remove foil and bake another 15 minutes until bubbly and golden. Let it rest for 10 minutes before serving to allow the layers to set properly.</p>
