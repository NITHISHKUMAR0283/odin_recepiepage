    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Chicken stir-fry is a quick and versatile dish that combines tender pieces of chicken with crisp, colorful vegetables in a savory sauce. The beauty of stir-fry lies in its high-heat, fast-cooking method that preserves the vegetables' vibrant colors and crunchy texture while keeping the chicken juicy and flavorful. The dish typically features a glossy, umami-rich sauce made from soy sauce, garlic, and ginger that coats every ingredient without making it soggy. What makes stir-fry so appealing is its flexibility - you can use whatever vegetables you have on hand, from classic bell peppers and broccoli to snap peas, mushrooms, or zucchini. The entire dish comes together in under 15 minutes, making it perfect for busy weeknight dinners. When served over fluffy steamed rice or noodles, it creates a complete, balanced meal that's both satisfying and nutritious, with the rice helping to absorb the delicious sauce.</p>
